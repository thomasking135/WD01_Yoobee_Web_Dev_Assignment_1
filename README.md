The aim is to apply the fundamentals of HTML,CSS to develop a multiple-page
website.

The website that I built was a 2 page website for a fictitious fish and chip shop in Akaroa a small town on the Eastern side of the South Island of New Zealand.

  <li>valid BEM CSS</li>
  <li>Use of CSS and Flexbox</li>
  <li>the use of pseudo classes</li>
  <li>the use of pseudo elements</li>
  </ul>
